# CIPP (Cyberdrain Improved Partner Portal)

CIPP (Cyberdrain Improved Partner Portal) is a multi-tenant management tool for Microsoft 365, making it easy to manage multiple clients from a centralized portal experience. It is also an open-source project.

It centralizes administration across tenants so MSPs do not have to log into each environment separately.

You can switch between tenants or manage all tenants at once from the top bar.

## Features

### User Management
- Adding users  
- Resetting passwords  

### Offboarding Wizards
- Automates mailbox conversion  
- Disables sign-in  
- Converts mailbox to shared mailbox  

### Conditional Access
- Conditional Access policies that can be applied across multiple tenants at once  

## Overall Impression

Overall, CIPP feels like a natural extension of the Microsoft 365 Administrator portal, but with extra features and automation that make it much easier to use.

# GDAP (Granular Delegated Admin Privileges)

GDAP allows an MSP (like a company using CIPP) to get permission to manage a customer’s Microsoft 365 tenants without being Global Admins inside their environment.

Before GDAP, MSPs used DAP (Delegated Admin Privileges), which gave too much access.
