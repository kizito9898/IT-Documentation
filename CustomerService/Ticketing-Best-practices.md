##  Ticketing Best Practices (My Personal Flow)

**My Goal**: Make every ticket clear, helpful, and professional, so anyone reading it knows exactly what happened and when.

### The Golden Rule I Follow

I treat ticket notes like a timeline. Whether I’ve found the solution or not, **I leave a note every 15 minutes** to show progress and steps taken so far to while actively working on the issue.

> *Still troubleshooting, just finished resetting the user profile, now checking login permissions. Will update again shortly.*

Why? Because:

- It shows I’m actively working
- It keeps the client and team informed
- It builds a clear history in case of escalation

### My Personal Ticketing Workflow

1. **Start of Ticket – I summarize the request clearly**

   > *User reports they are unable to log in. Error message: "Account locked." Happening since 8:45 AM.*

2. **Mid-Ticket – I document every key action I take**

   > *Checked AD—user account was locked due to 5 failed logins. Unlocked the account and had user attempt login again.*

3. **Ongoing Updates – I log every 10–15 minutes if issue is not yet resolved**

   > *Still working—checked user device remotely, noticed sync issues with domain. Rejoining to domain now.*

4. **Closing the Ticket – I confirm the fix and client satisfaction**

   > *User able to log in successfully after domain rejoin. Confirmed access to all mapped drives and Outlook. User confirmed everything is working. Ticket closed.*

5. **Escalating? – I summarize clearly for the next tech**

   > *Issue unresolved—user’s GPO settings not applying. Tried local fixes, no success. Escalating to Level 2. Please see Event Viewer logs from 12:05 PM.*

### Tips I Follow in Ticket Notes

- I **avoid vague notes** like “Still working.” I always say *what* I’m doing.
- I use **timestamps** if needed, especially when updating over time.
- I write as if someone else will pick up the ticket.
- I never assume knowledge—**I explain every step** I take.
- I keep notes **professional but human**—it reflects well on me.

**Final Thought**

it’s a reflection of your reliability as an engineer. I take pride in making sure my notes are clear, complete, and easy to follow.
