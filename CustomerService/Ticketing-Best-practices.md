# Ticketing Best Practices (My Personal Workflow)

## Objective

My goal is to ensure every support ticket is clear, accurate, and professionally written. A well-documented ticket should provide full context, show visible progress, and allow anyone, technicians, clients, or managers, to quickly understand what happened, when it happened, and what actions were taken.

Good ticketing builds trust, improves collaboration across teams, and supports accountability in managed environments.

---
## My Core Principle

I treat every ticket like a technical timeline. Whether the issue is ongoing or resolved, I update the ticket regularly, especially during active troubleshooting.

If an issue is still in progress, I leave meaningful updates every 10–15 minutes. These updates include timestamps and the specific steps taken, not generic statements.

**Example:**

`[10:15 AM] Reset user profile, still receiving login error. Currently checking authentication logs on the domain controller.`

This approach ensures transparency, continuity, and readiness for escalation if needed.

## My Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Initial Summary

I start every ticket with a clear description of the issue, including the user’s report, exact error messages (if any), and the time the problem began.

**Example:**

`[9:42 AM] User reports being unable to log in since 8:45 AM. Error message displayed: "Account locked. Contact administrator." Issue reported via email.`

---
### 2. Documentation of Actions

For every step I take, I record what was done, why it was done, and what the result was.

**Example:**

`[9:50 AM] Checked Active Directory – user account was locked after multiple failed attempts. Unlocked account and asked user to try logging in again.`

---
### 3. In-Progress Updates

If the issue is ongoing, I provide updates at reasonable intervals (typically every 10–15 minutes), detailing what I’m doing in that timeframe.

**Examples:**

`[10:05 AM] Remote session established. Reviewing logs on user machine.`  
`[10:15 AM] Found Event ID 1058 – Group Policy error. Investigating DNS resolution and SYSVOL access.`

This not only helps with visibility, but it also provides coverage in case the ticket needs to be handed off or escalated.

---
### 4. Ticket Closure

Before closing a ticket, I confirm that the issue is fully resolved, services are restored, and the user is satisfied.

**Example:**

`[10:30 AM] User able to log in after correcting DNS settings and restarting workstation. Confirmed access to Outlook, mapped drives, and company apps. User confirmed everything is working.`  
`Closing ticket.`

---
### 5. Escalation Summary (When Applicable)

If a ticket needs to be escalated to Level 2 or another department, I provide a clear and concise summary of what’s been done and where the issue currently stands. I include any logs, screenshots, or observations that may be useful for the next technician.

**Example:**

`[10:40 AM] Issue persists – GPO not applying correctly. Verified user and machine accounts, tried gpupdate /force, no success.`  
`Escalating to SysAdmin team. Uploaded screenshots of Event Viewer logs and attached gpresult output.`

## Ticket Note Writing Standards I Follow

- I avoid vague comments like “Still troubleshooting.” I always specify exactly what I'm doing.
- I include timestamps when writing ongoing updates.
- I write as if the next person to read the ticket has no prior context.
- I explain every action taken, what was checked, what was changed, and what result it produced.
- I stay neutral and professional in tone, while keeping notes easy to read.
- I do not include unnecessary technical jargon if it doesn’t add value to the note.
- I always include the client’s confirmation before closing, either via email, chat, or voice.
---
## Why This Matters

In an MSP environment, technicians often work across multiple clients, systems, and time zones. A well-documented ticket is not just helpful, it’s essential.

It:
- Shows consistent effort and professionalism
- Reduces back-and-forth with clients
- Allows seamless handover during shift transitions
- Protects against miscommunication or disputes
- Improves root cause analysis and long-term solutions
## Final Thought

The quality of my ticket notes reflects the quality of my work. They show how I think, how I solve problems, and how I communicate. Whether a ticket is simple or complex, I take pride in making sure my documentation is thorough, accurate, and easy for others to follow.

That’s how I maintain trust with clients, teammates, and managers in a fast-paced MSP environment.
# Ticketing Best Practices – Extended Guide

## Objective

To create consistent, professional, and useful documentation that reflects the quality of my support, improves team collaboration, and builds trust with both clients and managers.
## Core Principles

- Document everything as a **timeline**
- Use **clear, direct language** with technical accuracy
- Assume **handover is always possible** – write so any colleague can continue the work
- Keep the tone **professional and neutral**
- Include the **client's confirmation** before closing
- Log timestamps and actions every 10–15 minutes during active troubleshooting

## Standard Ticket Structure

### 1. Initial Client Report
Clearly summarize the issue based on the user's report. Include error messages, time of occurrence, and the method of contact.
### 2. Technical Steps Taken
Log each action taken in detail, along with any findings or results.
### 3. Ongoing Updates
Use timestamps and explain what you're investigating or testing.
### 4. Resolution and Confirmation
Clearly state what fixed the issue and confirm the user is satisfied.
### 5. Escalation (if needed)
Summarize all actions taken, findings, and next steps. Attach logs or screenshots if necessary.

  ## Best Practices for Notes  - Use **bulletproof clarity** – no abbreviations unless widely known (e.g. AD, VPN) - Mention **tools used** (RDP, AnyDesk, ADUC, CMD) - Include **logs or command output summaries** when useful - If issue recurs, use tags or keywords so it’s searchable later - Keep your tone **calm, courteous, and composed** – especially if notes are visible to clients  ---  ## What I Avoid  - Writing vague notes like “Issue fixed” without stating what was done - Leaving notes with no time reference or status - Using emotional or sarcastic language - Copy-pasting logs without context - Closing a ticket without user confirmation or proper follow-up 
  
## Follow-Up Example (Email or Internal Note)`

[04:45 PM] Followed up via email:

Subject: Follow-Up on Your Outlook Issue

Hi Sarah,

Just checking in to make sure everything is still working after the fix applied earlier today. If you're still experiencing any issues, let me know and I’ll be happy to assist further.

Best regards,  
IT Support.


  ## **Final Thought  Ticket notes aren’t just documentation—they’re your professional signature. The way you write reflects how seriously you treat each issue. I aim to ensure my notes tell the full story, support accountability, and help other technicians (or clients) understand exactly what was done.`
