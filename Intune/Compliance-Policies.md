## Compliance
Compliance refers to the process of ensuring that devices should meet specific security and configuration requirements before they can access corporate resources.

### Compliance Policies:
These define the security requirements that devices must meet:
- Require BitLocker encryption.
- Enforce password complexity.
- Require a specific OS version (Windows 10/11).
- Ensure antivirus/anti-malware is enabled.

### Conditional Access Integration:
Compliance policies can be used with Entra ID Conditional Access to block or restrict access to company resources if a device is non-compliant.

### Monitoring & Reporting:
Intune provides reports on device compliance status, helping IT admins take action on non-compliant devices.
