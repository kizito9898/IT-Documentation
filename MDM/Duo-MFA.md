# Duo Mobile / MFA

##  What is Duo Mobile?
Duo Mobile is a mobile application developed by Cisco that supports **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.  
It is used to verify a user’s identity by requiring a second step of verification in addition to a username and password.

When logging into an account that has Duo enabled, the user will receive a **push notification** on their mobile device.  
The user must approve the login attempt in the Duo app to gain access.
