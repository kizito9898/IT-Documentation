# Exchange Admin Center - Email Forwarding & Delegate Access
 
As an IT Support professional, you'll often need to configure **email forwarding** (to automatically send emails to another mailbox) or **delegate access** (allowing someone else to send or manage emails on behalf of a user). This guide walks you through both processes step by step.

---

## 📤 Email Forwarding in Exchange Admin Center  

###  What is Email Forwarding?  
Email forwarding allows you to automatically send incoming emails from one mailbox to another. This is useful when:  
- A user is on vacation or leave.  
- Someone is transitioning to a new role.  
- An executive needs their emails forwarded to an assistant.  

###  How to Enable Email Forwarding  
1. **Log in** to [Exchange Admin Center](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com).  
2. Go to **Recipients** > **Mailboxes**.  
3. Click on the mailbox you want to configure.  
4. Under **Mail Flow Settings**, click **Manage** next to **Email Forwarding**.  
5. Toggle **“Forward all emails sent to this mailbox”** to **ON**.  
6. Enter the recipient’s email address.    
7. Click **Save**.  

✅ Now, all incoming emails will be forwarded to the chosen address!  

### 🔄 How to Disable Email Forwarding  
1. Navigate to **Mail Flow Settings** > **Email Forwarding**.  
2. Toggle the forwarding option **OFF**.  
3. Click **Save**.  

💡 **Tip:** If forwarding isn’t working, check if there's an Exchange transport rule overriding the setting.

## 👥 Delegate Access (Send As, Send on Behalf, Full Access)  

###  What is Delegate Access?  
Delegate access lets a user **send, read, or fully manage another mailbox’s emails**. This is helpful when:  
- An assistant needs to send emails on behalf of an executive.  
- A shared mailbox requires multiple people to send and receive emails.  
- A user temporarily needs access to another mailbox.  

### 🔍 Types of Delegate Access  
- **Send on Behalf:** The delegate can send emails on behalf of the mailbox owner. The recipient sees: `Sent on behalf of [Owner Name]`.  
- **Send As:** The delegate can send emails that appear to come directly from the owner. No "on behalf" label.  
- **Full Access:** The delegate can **open, read, delete, and manage** all emails in the mailbox.  

###  How to Assign Delegate Access  
1. **Log in** to [Exchange Admin Center](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com).  
2. Go to **Recipients** > **Mailboxes**.  
3. Click the mailbox that needs delegate access.  
4. Scroll down to **Mailbox Permissions**.  
5. Click **Manage mailbox delegation**.  
6. Add users under:  
   - **Send As** (if they should send emails as the mailbox owner).  
   - **Send on Behalf** (if emails should show "on behalf of").  
   - **Full Access** (if they need full control).  
7. Click **Save**.  

✅ Now, the selected users have the required access!  

### 🛑 How to Remove Delegate Access  
1. Navigate to **Mailbox Permissions** > **Manage mailbox delegation**.  
2. Remove the user from **Send As, Send on Behalf, or Full Access**.  
3. Click **Save**.  

💡 **Pro Tip:** For shared mailboxes, permissions can also be managed via **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** under **Teams & Groups > Shared Mailboxes**.

---

## Troubleshooting  
✅ **Email forwarding isn’t working?**  
- Check if there’s a conflicting **mail flow rule** in **Exchange Admin Center > Mail Flow > Rules**.  
- Ensure the forwarding user’s mailbox isn’t full.  
- Verify the correct recipient email was added.  

✅ **Delegate access isn’t working?**  
- If the user can't send emails as the owner, ensure **Send As** permission is set.  
- If emails appear as "on behalf of" instead of directly from the sender, check **Send As vs. Send on Behalf** permissions.  
- Allow time for changes to sync across Microsoft 365 (can take up to **1 hour**).
