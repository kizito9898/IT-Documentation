# 1. Understanding File Storage in Microsoft Teams  

### Where Are Files Stored?  
Teams uses different storage locations depending on how a file is shared:  

1. **Files in Teams Channels** – Stored in SharePoint.  
2. **Files in Private Chats** – Stored in OneDrive.  
3. **Meeting Attachments** – Stored in OneDrive or SharePoint.  

### Key Differences Between SharePoint and OneDrive  

| Feature          | SharePoint (Teams Channels)             | OneDrive (Private Chats)                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Storage Location | Team-based storage                      | Individual user storage                   |
| Access Control   | Managed by team owners                  | Managed by the file owner                 |
| Collaboration    | Files are available to all team members | Files are only available to invited users |
