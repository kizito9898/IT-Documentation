## PowerShell

### What is PowerShell?
- A **PowerShell Cmdlet** is a lightweight, single-function command built into PowerShell for performing specific tasks.  
- PowerShell is a **command-line shell** and **scripting language** created by Microsoft.  
- A **shell** means you can type commands (like `ping`, `ipconfig`) but with more advanced capabilities.  
- A **scripting language** means you can write a list of commands in a file (a **script**) so they run automatically instead of typing them one by one.  

### Why Use PowerShell?
- With PowerShell scripting, you can:
  - Perform **Active Directory tasks** ‚Üí Create, disable, or reset 50 user accounts at once.  
  - Handle **Microsoft 365 / Intune tasks** ‚Üí Assign licenses, reset passwords, configure settings.  
  - Run **system checks** ‚Üí Pull logs, check disk space, list installed software on 100 machines.  
  - Enable **automation** ‚Üí Instead of manually patching machines or running updates, script it once and run it everywhere. # Downloading Powershell 7.4.5 

* Go to Microsoft‚Äôs official GitHub release page:  
  [https://github.com/powershell/powershell/releases](https://github.com/powershell/powershell/releases)  
  ‚Üí Under **Assets**, download the **.msi installer** for Windows (x64 bit)  
  ‚Üí Example: `powershell-7.4.5-win-x64.msi`  
  ‚Üí Run the installer. ‚úÖ  

* PowerShell aims to be **cross-platform**, running on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.  

* Download **Visual Studio Code** to practice PowerShell fundamentals ‚Üí linked with PowerShell Core.  



### Key Notes
- An **alias** in PowerShell is a shortcut or alternate name for a cmdlet or command.  
- You can always **download a higher version of PowerShell** if your current version is outdated.
## Variables
* A variable is a **named storage location** for data (string, number, object, etc).  
* Always starts with `$` in PowerShell.  
* Think of it as a **container that stores data you can reuse**.  
## Alias
* An alias is just a **shortcut (nickname)** for a longer cmdlet, command, or function.  
* It makes typing faster, but the command still runs the **full version** in the background.
## Comparison Operators
* In PowerShell, comparison operators are used to **compare values** (numbers, strings, or objects).  
* They return either **True or False**.  
## Arrays
* An array is just a **list of items** stored in a single variable.  
* Instead of having one value, an array can hold **multiple values at once** (numbers, strings, objects, etc).  
## Hashtable
* A hashtable uses **specific keys**.  
* It is a **data structure** that stores **key‚Äìvalue pairs**.  
## Hashtable Example

`$fellowshipData = @{     Key1 = "Item1"     Key2 = "Item2" }`

A **hashtable** in PowerShell stores data as **key-value pairs**. Keys must be unique, and you can retrieve values by referencing their keys.

## Functions in PowerShell

A **function** in PowerShell is a reusable block of code that you define once and call multiple times.

### Syntax

`function Get-Greeting {     param([string]$Name)     "Hello, $Name! Welcome to PowerShell." }`

### Usage

`Get-Greeting -Name "Kizito"`

Functions help you **avoid repeating long scripts** and make your automation modular.

---

## Using the Ping Command

PowerShell allows you to test network connectivity using `Test-Connection` (instead of legacy `ping`).

`Test-Connection google.com -Count 4`

This sends ICMP echo requests and returns the response time, similar to `ping`.

---

## Creating a New File in PowerShell

`New-Item -Path "C:\Users\User\example.txt" -ItemType File`

Creates a blank text file in the specified path.

- `-Path` specifies the location.
    
- `-ItemType File` ensures it's a file (not folder).
    

---

## Creating and Saving Command Output to a File

### Example: Save Ping Results

`Test-Connection google.com -Count 4 | Out-File "C:\Users\User\PingResults.txt"`

- `Out-File` saves the output of a command into a text file.
    
- Useful for logging troubleshooting steps.
    

---

## Delete a File in PowerShell

`Remove-Item -Path "C:\Users\User\example.txt"`

- Deletes the specified file.
    
- Add `-Force` if the file is hidden or read-only.
    
- Add `-Recurse` if deleting a folder with contents.
    

---

## Additional Best Practices & Notes (Added)

### Aliases vs Full Cmdlets

- Always prefer **full cmdlets** in scripts (`Remove-Item` instead of `rm`) for readability.
    
- Aliases are good for typing faster interactively.
    

### Cmdlet Naming Convention

PowerShell follows **Verb-Noun** convention:

- `Get-Process`
    
- `Start-Service`
    
- `Stop-Computer`
    

Use `Get-Verb` to see approved verbs.

### Help System

You can always check help:

`Get-Help New-Item -Examples`

### Piping & Redirection

- `|` sends the output of one command into another.
    
- Example:
    

`Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 5`

Shows top 5 processes by CPU usage.

### Error Handling

Use `Try { } Catch { }` for handling errors gracefully.

`Try {     Get-Item "C:\NonExistentFile.txt" } Catch {     Write-Output "File not found!" }`

Got it üëç ‚Äî I‚Äôll convert everything from your handwritten notes into **clean Markdown for Obsidian**. Here‚Äôs the formatted version:

`# Active Directory (PowerShell)  ## Overview PowerShell Active Directory refers to the use of the Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell to manage and automate tasks in Microsoft Active Directory.    It uses PowerShell commands (cmdlets) to perform operations such as: - Creating, modifying, and deleting users and computers   - Managing groups and organizational units   - Resetting passwords and unlocking accounts   - Querying Active Directory for information (e.g., last logon times, group membership)   - Automating bulk changes across multiple objects    ---  ## Getting Started To work with PowerShell in Active Directory, you need to import the module to get the commands for Active Directory automation.    ### Steps: 1. Navigate to the Start Menu ‚Üí search for **PowerShell**   2. Right-click and **Run as Administrator**   3. In PowerShell, run:      ```powershell    Import-Module ActiveDirectory`

### Checking Commands

To view available commands:

`Get-Command`

## Creating a New Organizational Unit (OU) with PowerShell

You can create a new OU in Active Directory using this cmdlet:

`New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "CentralUnit" -Path "DC=Njikasm,DC=com"`

- `-Name` specifies the OU name
    
- `-Path` specifies the domain structure where it will be created
    

`---  Would you like me to also add **examples for creating users and groups** (since they‚Äôre often paired with OU creation in Tier 1/2 AD tasks)? That way your Obsidian note will be more complete.`
