## PowerShell

### What is PowerShell?
- A **PowerShell Cmdlet** is a lightweight, single-function command built into PowerShell for performing specific tasks.  
- PowerShell is a **command-line shell** and **scripting language** created by Microsoft.  
- A **shell** means you can type commands (like `ping`, `ipconfig`) but with more advanced capabilities.  
- A **scripting language** means you can write a list of commands in a file (a **script**) so they run automatically instead of typing them one by one.  

### Why Use PowerShell?
- With PowerShell scripting, you can:
  - Perform **Active Directory tasks** → Create, disable, or reset 50 user accounts at once.  
  - Handle **Microsoft 365 / Intune tasks** → Assign licenses, reset passwords, configure settings.  
  - Run **system checks** → Pull logs, check disk space, list installed software on 100 machines.  
  - Enable **automation** → Instead of manually patching machines or running updates, script it once and run it everywhere.  

### Key Notes
- An **alias** in PowerShell is a shortcut or alternate name for a cmdlet or command.  
- You can always **download a higher version of PowerShell** if your current version is outdated.
