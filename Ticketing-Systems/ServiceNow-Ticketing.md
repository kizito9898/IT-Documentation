# ServiceNow as a Ticketing System

While ServiceNow can do a lot, its core use for **IT Support** is as a **ticketing system** – a place to manage and track problems users report, requests they make, and the steps Support teams take to resolve those issues.

For most helpdesk or IT support agents, **ServiceNow** is where:

- You receive **tickets** (issues or requests from users).
- **Communicate with users** through *Additional Comments* (Customer Visible).
- **Log** what you're doing in *Internal Work Notes*.
- **Escalate** issues to the right team.
- **Close out** tickets with proper documentation.

> For IT Support, if it’s not in the ticket, it didn’t happen.

### 2. Service Requests
Used when users want something that isn’t broken.

### 3. Problems
Used to investigate the **underlying cause** of one or more incidents.  
Example: *If 10 users report VPN dropping every morning, a problem ticket might be opened to identify the root cause.*
