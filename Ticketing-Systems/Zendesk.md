## Zendesk as a Tool for IT Support

For IT support, Zendesk functions as a ticketing system that allows IT teams to:

- Log and track incidents and service requests.
- Assign and prioritize tickets based on urgency and impact.
- Collaborate internally with team members using private notes.
- Communicate with end users via email, web forms, or chat.
- Create automations and workflows to reduce manual work.
- Use macros (predefined responses) to resolve common issues faster.
- Access a knowledge base to share articles and self-help guides with users.
- Generate reports and analytics to track support performance (SLAs, response times, etc.).

# Ticketing System Tips

- **Always show empathy for the customer.**  
  Example:  
  > I'm going to have that fixed. Let me help you.  
  > Definitely reach out to IT helpdesk or me if you have any other issues. I hope you have a great day.

- **Make sure to look at old tickets** if you've never seen an issue before.
- **Google is your best friend too.**  
  (Remember: no one knows everything.)
- **Understand where the ticket goes.**
- **Whenever you close a ticket, put notes on it.**
- **Why notes?**  
  You might see that issue again.

- **Be sure to attach all any approved emails** on the ticket or notes inside the ticket.
- **Use the ticket system to your advantage** by looking at old tickets.
- **Follow your tickets that were assigned to you**, even if you gave it to someone else, like Level 2.
- **Always update your tickets every day.**  
  (Managers check this.)

- **Always communicate with the client after closing a ticket.**  
  Don’t just close the ticket because you feel like it.
