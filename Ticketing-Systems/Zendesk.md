## Zendesk as a Tool for IT Support
![Screenshot](images/screenshot270.jpg)
For IT support, Zendesk functions as a ticketing system that allows IT teams to:

- Log and track incidents and service requests.
- Assign and prioritize tickets based on urgency and impact.
- Collaborate internally with team members using private notes.
- Communicate with end users via email, web forms, or chat.
- Create automations and workflows to reduce manual work.
- Use macros (predefined responses) to resolve common issues faster.
- Access a knowledge base to share articles and self-help guides with users.
- Generate reports and analytics to track support performance (SLAs, response times, etc.).

# Ticketing System Tips

- **Always show empathy for the customer.**  
  Example:  
  > I'm going to have that fixed. Let me help you.  
  > Definitely reach out to IT helpdesk or me if you have any other issues. I hope you have a great day.

- **Make sure to look at old tickets** if you've never seen an issue before.
- **Google is your best friend too.**  
  (Remember: no one knows everything.)
- **Understand where the ticket goes.**
- **Whenever you close a ticket, put notes on it.**
- **Why notes?**  
  You might see that issue again.

- **Be sure to attach all any approved emails** on the ticket or notes inside the ticket.
- **Use the ticket system to your advantage** by looking at old tickets.
- **Follow your tickets that were assigned to you**, even if you gave it to someone else, like Level 2.

- **Always update your tickets every day.**  
  (Managers check this.)

- **Always communicate with the client after closing a ticket.**  
  Don’t just close the ticket because you feel like it.

# Ticket Management Tips

This helps IT Support or Customer Service Teams manage tickets and provide better support based on group context.
## As a Help Desk Agent (non-admin) using Zendesk
My focus is solely on efficient handling of tickets, documenting well, and providing excellent support.
### Internal Notes
- Use internal notes for logging actions without the user seeing.
- Internal notes are really important to reference back in case the same issue should arise.
- It also helps you follow agents on steps taken to resolve an issue.
- Managers use it to track performance.
### Ticket Fields
- Understanding ticketing system in IT is very important from: Priority, Type, Tags, Group, Assignee.
# Additional Ticket Handling Best Practices

-  I document steps taken, tools used, and resolution steps.  
- Add timestamps if required by your team.  
-  Stay professional, polite, and helpful.  
- Thank the user, apologize where needed, and set expectations

# Handling a Task Request from My Supervisor

-  **supervisor/manager requested** to onboard a new employee and set up the necessary account.  
-  **Supervisor created a ticket** to onboard and set up the account.  
-  Ticket like this **usually comes with low priority** since it's not affecting productivity. 
-  Usually comes as a **task to complete with a deadline**.
- Set up the user account, add to relevant group, set right permissions and outlook
